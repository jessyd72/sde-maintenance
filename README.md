 Database maintenenace functions for enterprise geodatases
 
 DB-maintenance-funcs.py completes recommended geodatabase maintenance on a traditional versioned database using either an existing
connection string or a new connection string built during run. Connection file or requirements to build connection must be stored
in the config.json file. An environemnt must be specified in the env.json file (dev, stage, or prod). 
Recommended geodatabase maintenance includes:
- Reconciling and posting all child versions
- Compressing the database to state 0
- Rebuilding all indexes (spatial, attribute, and database)
- Analzye datasets to recalculate statistics
